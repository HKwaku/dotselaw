## How to Add Logos

2. **Place them** in this folder (`public/associations/`)
3. **Refresh your website** - logos will appear automatically
4. **No code changes needed!**

## Design Tips

### Best Practices
- Use official logo files from each organization
- Ensure logos are clear and professional
- Maintain consistent sizing across all logos
- Test logos on both light and dark backgrounds

### Common Sources
- Organization's official website (press/media section)
- Organization's brand guidelines
- Direct request from the organization

### Image Optimization
Before uploading, optimize your logos:
- **Online tools:** TinyPNG, Squoosh
- **Remove backgrounds:** Use PNG format
- **Resize:** To approximately 200px × 200px
- **Compress:** Reduce file size without losing quality

## Troubleshooting

### Logo Not Showing?
1. Check filename matches exactly (case-sensitive)
2. Verify file is in correct folder
3. Ensure file format is supported (PNG, JPG, SVG, WebP)
4. Clear browser cache and refresh

### Logo Looks Distorted?
1. Use square or proportional dimensions
2. Check if logo has transparent background
3. Ensure minimum 200px resolution
4. Don't upscale small images

### Logo Quality Issues?
1. Use higher resolution source
2. Export at 2x size for retina displays
3. Use vector format (SVG) if available
4. Request official logo from organization

## Alternative: Text Only

If you don't have logos yet, the website will display the association names as text. The design still looks professional without logos.

## Updates

To update a logo:
1. Replace the file with the same filename
2. Clear browser cache
3. Refresh the website
